	// the same as pattern "foo". "**/foo/bar" matches file or directory
	// "bar" anywhere that is directly under directory "foo".

	// A trailing "/**" matches everything inside. For example, "abc/**"
	// matches all files inside directory "abc", relative to the location
	// of the .gitignore file, with infinite depth.

	// A slash followed by two consecutive asterisks then a slash matches
	// zero or more directories. For example, "a/**/b" matches "a/b",
